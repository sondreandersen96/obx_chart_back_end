# OBX Chart Back-end
This is a simple Flask API created with Python.

This application serves as the back-end for [my other project](https://github.com/sondreandersen96/obx_chart_front_end).

The app.py script is the API. The /database folder contains the scripts that creates/updates/populates the SQLite3 database that the API used to fetch data.
